        <p>
          Long before AI became a course topic at Beihang, it was already part of how I worked.
          I had been using ChatGPT since 2023 — not as a shortcut, but as a thinking partner.
          When I couldn't articulate a concept clearly, I'd argue it out with the model until
          the logic held. When a method felt shaky, I'd describe it to ChatGPT and let the
          holes surface through the questions it asked back.
        </p>
        <p>
          The most important thing AI ever did for my research was the diagnosis. I asked
          ChatGPT to evaluate me — not to reassure me, but to find what was structurally wrong.
          It came back with 28 identified patterns across six categories. At the centre of
          all of them was perfectionism: the habit of optimising for being right rather than
          being attack-resistant. That single insight, surfaced through an AI-assisted
          self-assessment, changed how I approach every piece of work since.
        </p>
        <p>
          Claude Code entered the workflow at the manuscript stage. It built the entire
          Python processing pipeline — TROPOSIF extraction, footprint masking, CHIRPS
          integration, statistical testing, figure generation. Six scripts. Every figure
          in the paper came from code we wrote together in this city, describing a geography
          10,000 km away.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the second manuscript and beyond, AI is not a tool I turn to when I am stuck.
          It is a permanent part of the research architecture — from hypothesis stress-testing
          to SAR integration pipelines to writing iteration. The question is not whether to
          use AI in scientific research. The question is how to use it rigorously enough that
          it sharpens rather than softens the work.
        </p>
        <p style="color:var(--accent-gold);font-style:italic;margin-top:1rem">
          "The goal is not to let AI think for you. The goal is to let it
          show you where your thinking breaks down."

        <p>
          Perfectionism is the theme that runs through everything. At its worst, it disguises
          itself as discipline. In practice, it is a fear of exposure. I delay showing work
          not because it genuinely needs more polish, but because I already know where the
          gaps are and I do not want anyone else to find them before I close them myself.
          A structured self-assessment conducted with ChatGPT surfaced this as the root cause
          behind 28 distinct patterns across six categories of weakness.
        </p>
        <p>
          The downstream effects are predictable once you see them clearly. I would build
          conceptual frameworks before the core results were stable. I would over-iterate
          internally instead of exposing drafts early to external critique. I would allow
          spatial scale inconsistencies to persist in the analysis because committing to one
          scale felt like closing a door I might need later. All of these are perfectionism
          in disguise — a reluctance to make the work vulnerable before it is "ready", even
          though readiness is precisely what external feedback produces.
        </p>
        <p>
          The remaining weaknesses, including causality overreach, weak separation of claim
          types, and precision loss under complexity, are secondary. They matter, and they
          are being addressed, but they are not the engine. The engine is the same impulse
          to optimise for being right rather than being attack-resistant. The Scientific
          Writing course at Beihang made this worse before it made it better: learning exactly
          what a rigorous paper looks like raised the internal bar to a height I could not yet
          reach, which caused more delay. The cure turned out to be the same as the diagnosis:
          expose the work earlier, let it be broken deliberately, and iterate with external
          feedback rather than internal perfection.
        </p>
        <p style="color:var(--accent-gold);font-style:italic">
          The question is not "Is this good enough?" It is "Can this survive peer review?"
          Those two questions produce completely different papers.
