  abstract: `Tropical cyclones in Southern Africa cause severe ecological disruption, yet conventional
  vegetation indices like NDVI often miss the full extent of photosynthetic damage. This study uses
  Solar Induced Fluorescence (SIF) derived from the TROPOMI sensor aboard Sentinel-5P to quantify
  vegetation physiological responses to cyclone events across Southern Africa. By analysing SIF signals
  at multiple spatial aggregation scales and linking them to CHIRPS rainfall anomalies, we identify
  scale-dependent patterns of stress, suppression, and recovery that NDVI alone cannot resolve.
  Cyclones Idai (2019), Chalane (2021), and Freddy (2023) serve as primary case studies.`,

From Mutare, Zimbabwe to Hangzhou, China. A 10,000 km jump across continents, climates, and academic cultures.
Beihang University. One of China's top aerospace and remote sensing institutions.

I had already published one paper at bachelor's level, on change detection techniques in small-area studies in developing countries. That paper was the seed. It proved I could ask a rigorous question and answer it. But a masters research was different. Longer. Deeper. And I was starting it in a language I barely spoke, in a city I had never been to, surrounded by peers from across the world.

The first week was orientation, paperwork, and trying to read a campus map in Mandarin.
The second week, the real work began.`,

Spatial Data Science: how to think in maps, in scales, in projections.

Probability and Statistics: the grammar of scientific claims. Without this, every result is just a number.

GNSS Receiver Principals: signals, orbits, precision. It also taught me how TROPOMI, the sensor at the heart of my research, keeps its orbital geometry so precise.

Introduction to Space Technology: why we go to space, what we build, what we can see from there.

And Chinese. Two semesters of it. Because Hangzhou wasn't going to speak English back to me on the metro at midnight.

    story: `It started with a question that bothered me.

Cyclones devastate Southern Africa. We know this. We see it on news, in aid reports,
in satellite images of flattened forests and flooded coastlines.
But how do you actually measure what a cyclone does to vegetation —
not just structurally, but physiologically?

NDVI tells you leaves are gone.
But SIF — Solar Induced Fluorescence — tells you whether the remaining leaves
are still photosynthesising. It's the difference between an ECG
and just checking if someone is still standing.

TROPOMI, aboard Sentinel-5P, has been measuring SIF from space since 2018.
The data exists. Nobody had used it specifically to trace cyclone impacts
at multiple spatial scales across Southern Africa.

That was the gap. That became my study.

Cyclone Idai. Chalane. Freddy. Three storms.
One question: what does the SIF signal tell us that nothing else does?`,

    story: `There is a particular kind of quiet that comes at 2am in a city of 22 million people

Zimbabwe is warm in ways that Beijing in winter is not.
The light is different. The air is different.
The rhythm of conversations at home — in Shona, in English, all mixed together —
is different from the corridors of Beihang.

My research is about Southern Africa. My study area is my home region.
Cyclone Idai did not hit an abstract geography. It hit communities.
It hit the Chimanimani mountains I know. It hit the lowveld I can picture.

Researching it from 10,000 km away carries a particular weight.
Every time I opened the TROPOMI data and looked at the SIF signal drop
over Sofala Province after Idai's landfall, I was not just looking at pixels.

That weight is not a weakness. It is a reason.`,

I ask "Is this good enough?"
when I should ask "Can this survive peer review?"

Perfectionism, it turns out, is not about standards.
It is about fear. Fear that if I show the work before it is perfect,
someone will find the gap I already know is there.

The Scientific Writing course at Beihang made this worse before it made it better.
Learning about PRISMA guidelines, journal metrics, Springer submission standards —
it raised the bar in my head to a height I could not yet reach.

The fix is not to lower the bar.
It is to expose the work earlier, break it deliberately,
and iterate with external feedback rather than internal perfection.

    story: `The manuscript started as a question.
Then it became a framework.

Four analytical pillars:

First — SIF as a physiological indicator.
Not just what a cyclone knocks down, but whether the vegetation that survives is still alive
in the photosynthetic sense. TROPOSIF data from TROPOMI gives us that.

Second — Spatial aggregation as a variable.
When you average SIF at country level, you lose the cyclone signal.
At the cyclone footprint scale, it screams.
The question became: at what scale does SIF become diagnostic?

Third — Rainfall timing.
CHIRPS data to map not just total rainfall during cyclone events,
but the timing relative to the phenological cycle.
A cyclone in peak growing season hits differently than one in dormancy.

Fourth — Ecoregion stratification.
Southern African savannas, miombo woodlands, and coastal forests respond differently.
A single response curve misleads. BIOME classification lets us separate them.

The framework took three iterations and two supervisor meetings to stabilise.
Version 1 was too ambitious. Version 2 was too narrow.
Version 3 was defensible.`,

Scientific Writing: seven lectures on how to write what I was already writing. Structure of a scientific paper, journal selection, PRISMA for systematic reviews, Harvard and IEEE citation standards. The irony of being taught to write while struggling to write was not lost on me.

AI and Large Models: a full course on the tools I was already using. I built the CLIMATE-XFER project here, domain adaptation for climate data. It sharpened my understanding of what AI tools actually do versus what I wished they did.

Intelligent Processing of Remote Sensing Images: SLIC superpixels, Random Forest classification, Segment Anything Model (SAM). The lab sessions ran directly into my SIF processing pipeline.

Team Project (HyPlant): an airborne hyperspectral SIF study alongside classmates. Cohen's d of 1.0 to 6.7 across drought-stressed zones. A parallel SIF story that sharpened my intuitions for the main manuscript.

This is the right approach.

The Methods section went through four complete revisions.
Not because it was wrong, but because defensible and technically correct
are two different things at publication level.

His comments on spatial scale were the same as my meta-weakness:
"You are reporting a relationship. You are not explaining why it exists at this scale."

The revisions taught me more than the original writing.

Iteration 1 — Methods structured around data sources.
Iteration 2 — Methods restructured around analytical questions.
Iteration 3 — Statistical framework formalised. Notation stabilised.
Iteration 4 — Limitation section expanded to actively constrain conclusions.

The SIF signal drop during Cyclone Idai's landfall in March 2019 was visible at the 1 degree footprint scale and invisible at country level. That one figure anchored the entire spatial aggregation argument.

Cyclone Freddy (2023) showed the longest recovery trajectory. NDVI recovered in 6 weeks. The physiological lag that SIF measures is real, and it is not visible in any other index.

The ecoregion analysis separated miombo woodland (fast recovery) from coastal lowland forest (slow, sometimes no recovery). Not a single response curve. A family of curves.

Claude Code built the processing pipeline: TROPOSIF extraction, footprint masking, CHIRPS integration, figure generation. Six Python scripts. Every figure in this paper came from that pipeline, written in Hangzhou, 10,000 km from the geography it describes.

Sentinel-1 SAR integration is planned: structural damage alongside physiological signal. A more complete picture of what a cyclone actually does to a forest.

I came from Mutare, Zimbabwe with a question. I am building the answer here, one revision at a time. The road is long. The signal is real. And I have learned, slowly, with help, that exposing unfinished work to criticism is not weakness. It is the method.
